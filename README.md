DecEvalSe_Research_Result_Verification

This repository serves the purpose to validate any research results used in Tables and Figures in our paper. In the paper the
discussion section gives a few words about verifiability.

We tend to publish the source code of the framework after acceptance, since otherwise it can give other researchers an advantage to publish results associated with this framework.
Nevertheless, we provide the "outputs" of the tool, and provide our anonymous reviewers some Python scripts to easily verify all results. The outputs can be verified individually and act like a proof of correctness.
